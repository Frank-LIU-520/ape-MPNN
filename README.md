Transferable Multi-level Attention Neural Network for Accurate Prediction of Quantum Chemistry Properties via Multi-task Learning

Champion solution of Coalab Alchemy Contest

DeepMoleNet is a deep learning package for molecular properties prediction. This code is developed by Ziteng Liu@Nanjing Univerisity and Liqiang Lin@Nanjing University during Colab Alchemy Contest https://alchemy.tencent.com/. We setup one team called "NJU_Chem" and won the champion in the competition. We also released document to disclose our thoughts during different stages after winning. Former DeepMoleNet was called ape-MPNN in the contest. Please see https://alchemy.tencent.com/data/2019/1st_solution-ape-MPNN_NJU_Chem.pdf for detail.

The ideas come from the discussion with our friends (starcraft â…¡ lovers) at the cafe shop (called Mole Cafe) in school of chemistry and chemical engineering building. So later we both decide to rename ape-MPNN to DeepMoleNet to remember this time our school time (my 2nd Ph.D. and his sophomore year).

1 unzip the zip file and make sure all packagement in the requirement.txt file are installed;

2 put molecule sdf files in the .\data-bin\raw\dev, with its sdf file name and all 12 properties saved in .\data-bin\raw\dev_target.csv in templet.

3 run the code, python DeepMoleNet.py
