Transferable Multi-level Attention Neural Network for Accurate Prediction of Quantum Chemistry Properties via Multi-task Learning

Champion solution of Codalab Alchemy Contest 
<br>https://alchemy.tencent.com/  
  

DeepMoleNet is a deep learning package for molecular properties prediction. This code was developed by Ziteng Liu@Nanjing Univerisity and Liqiang Lin@Nanjing University during Codalab Alchemy Contest https://alchemy.tencent.com/. We formed one team called "NJU_Chem" and won the champion in the competition. We also released document to disclose our thoughts during different stages in the competition. Former DeepMoleNet was called ape-MPNN in the contest. Please see https://alchemy.tencent.com/data/2019/1st_solution-ape-MPNN_NJU_Chem.pdf for detail.

Please go to the DeepMoleNet homepage, register, and download the code before usage in the following steps. 

1 unzip the zip file and make sure all packagement in the requirement.txt file are installed;

2 put molecule sdf files in the .\data-bin\raw\dev, with its sdf file name and all 12 properties saved in .\data-bin\raw\dev_target.csv in templet.

3 run the code, python DeepMoleNet.py
